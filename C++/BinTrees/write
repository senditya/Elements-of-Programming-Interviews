For my undergrad thesis I had proposed and implemented a deep learning setup capable of performing intelligent feature reduction on a dataset, given an ontology on the domain. The best performance resulted in a 63% data compression with simultaneous 74% clustering improvement (silhouette coefficient).
Recently I have developed the back end for an entire relational database management system from scratch in C++. The module can be included as a library in any C++ program and used to record, index and perform selection, projection, aggregation and join queries on relational data.
In another recent project, I proposed and contributed in development of an automated feature-extraction system to discover features in continuous time-series data for pattern recognition. 
One of the personal projects in my current to-do list is an automated caricature system that will be able to translate between multiple comic styles and even convert a real-life image to any such style. To take a smaller bite, I'm working towards automatic handwriting generation, given text.
I am also currently part of a course on Information Retrieval and as part of the course project am building a system for crawling the web and performing web search.
