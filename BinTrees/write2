Most of my projects have been in data mining, including feature engineering and artificial data generation. But recently, I have also started to get really interest in computer vision. I feel I will keep growing to like the field. I am very excited about deep learning applications as well, and neural networks are one of my most favorite machine learning models.
I am also interested in data management projects and would like to gain more exposure in developing various apps.
It's difficult to choose a favorite among Google products, but I think one of the most useful and almost irreplaceable Google products for me has been Google Maps. I would love to be part of a team that works on how to make maps work better, faster and more integrated with traffic and weather conditions as well as how to improve the Google Street View experience.
Another one of my absolute favorite products would be Youtube. I would love to be part of the work on the recommender engine for Youtube, especially for recommendation of music tracks.
As an area which I would really want to get more exposure, I believe I would choose distributed systems and parallel processing techniques. I think it is one of the most important and useful technical areas learning which will accelerate my technical growth a lot!
