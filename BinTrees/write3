My undergraduate thesis was on application of ontologies in clustering. I worked on how to use the knowledge represented in the hierarchy of an ontology to perform feature reduction on a related dataset. Reduction of the number of features can improve learning on a dataset if too much information is not lost in reducing the features. The best way to go about this is to remove features which do not add much to the variance between data. This is typically done through some algorithm such as PCA to discover the dimensions which carry the most information on data variation.
In my thesis, I proposed a model on the hierarchy tree of ontologies which enables an optimized application of PCA to the dataset. Instead of applying PCA on all the features in the data at once, I proposed applying PCA only on features which have an immediate common parent in the tree. The combination of siblings into groups to differentiate between cousins ensured that PCA is applied on a subset of features which are most similar and hence provide a large scope for feature reduction. This enabled reducing the features while throwing away the least possible information by the idea that siblings are more similar than cousins. If required, one can work up the levels in the hierarchy tree leading to more and more reduction in features.
To perform experiments, I needed a dataset with a large number of features along with an associated ontology. I chose the UniProt proteome dataset recording proteins present in organisms and the Gene Ontology to represent relations between proteins and their taxonomy. The algorithm was tested by running k-means clustering over the resultant dataset and calculating silhouette coefficient of the clustering.
The results showed a 69% reduction in features coupled with 74% improvement in clustering performance by running the algorithms for three levels of the ontology tree, starting from the leaf level features.
